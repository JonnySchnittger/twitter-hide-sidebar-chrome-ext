## Installation
Download and extract, view the code to make sure I'm not doing something evil (hint it's just CSS and a little JavaScript). Open up Chrome/Opera/Edge extensions and enable developer mode. Drag the extracted folder on to the extensions window and it should be installed automatically. Go to https://twitter.com (or refresh)
